## Linear Regression

For this lab, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.

```{r age}
#Adding age to the dataset
abalones <- abalones %>%
    mutate(age = (rings+1.5))

summary(abalones$age)
hist(abalones$age)

#Testing if age actually is gamma-distributed
gamma_test(abalones$age)
```

Abalone age is right-skewed and seems to be a gamma distribution with a median of 10.5 and a mean of 11.43 years.

Running the gamma_test function on age seems to confirm my initial suspicions, as we obtain a minuscule p-value, leading us to reject the null hypothesis that the data is not gamma distributed.



### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

```{r splitting}
set.seed(4777)


#Using an 80/20 split
abalones_split <- initial_split(abalones, prop = 0.8, strata = age)

abalones_train <- training(abalones_split)
abalones_test <- testing(abalones_split)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include `rings` to predict `age`. Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors

2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

```{r recipe}
#We shouldn't use rings to predict age because we don't want to have to cut the abalones open to calculate their age.



#Recipe
abalones_recipe <- recipe(age ~ type + longest_shell + diameter + height + whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight, data = abalones_train) %>% 
  step_dummy_multi_choice(type) %>%#Dummy coding type
  prep() %>%
  step_interact(terms = ~ type_F:type_I:type_M:shucked_weight + longest_shell:diameter + shucked_weight:shell_weight) %>%   #Creating interactions
  step_center(all_predictors()) %>%    #Centering predictors
  step_scale(all_predictors())       #Scaling predictors


```

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

``` {r lm Model}
lm_model <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm")

```

### Question 5

Now:

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model you created in Question 4, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

```{r workflow}
lm_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lm_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(abalones_recipe)
```

### Question 6

Use your `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.

```{r fit}
lm_fit <- fit(lm_wflow, abalones_train)

#Encoding hypothetical abalone into dataframe
hypothetical <- data.frame(
  type = "F",
  longest_shell = 0.5,
  diameter = 0.10,
  height = 0.30,
  whole_weight = 4,
  shucked_weight = 1,
  viscera_weight = 2,
  shell_weight = 1
)

predict(lm_fit, hypothetical)

```
Our model predicts the age of this hypothetical abalone to be about 23.8 years old.

### Question 7

Now you want to assess your model's performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **training data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R^2^* value.

``` {r metrics}
#Metric set
abalone_metrics <- metric_set(rsq, rmse, mae)

#Binding columns of actual age and predicted age together
abalone_train_res <- predict(lm_fit, new_data = abalones_train %>% dplyr::select(-age))
abalone_train_res <- bind_cols(abalone_train_res, abalones_train %>% dplyr::select(age))

#Applying metric set to above tibble
abalone_metrics(abalone_train_res, truth = age, estimate = .pred)

```
The *R^2^* value is the proportion of variance of age explained by the model to the total variance of age. For this model, it is about 54%, which is barely more reliable than flipping a coin. Much of this inaccuracy is probably due to almost all of our predictors being volume or weight related, with the exception of gender. Most animals don't continuously grow as they age, so size seems to be unreliable as a primary predictor past adulthood. Genetic variation in size and availability of food for any particular abalone in the data set are also likely external factors that correlate with size that we cannot factor in this particular model because we lack the data to do so.

### Required for 231 Students

In lecture, we presented the general bias-variance tradeoff, which takes the form:

$$
E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2]=Var(\hat{f}(x_0))+[Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2+Var(\epsilon)
$$

where the underlying model $Y=f(X)+\epsilon$ satisfies the following:

- $\epsilon$ is a zero-mean random noise term and $X$ is non-random (all randomness in $Y$ comes from $\epsilon$);
- $(x_0, y_0)$ represents a test observation, independent of the training set, drawn from the same model;
- $\hat{f}(.)$ is the estimate of $f$ obtained from the training set.

#### Question 8

Which term(s) in the bias-variance tradeoff above represent the reproducible error? Which term(s) represent the irreducible error?

#### Question 9

Using the bias-variance tradeoff above, demonstrate that the expected test error is always at least as large as the irreducible error.

#### Question 10

Prove the bias-variance tradeoff.

Hints:

- use the definition of $Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))=E[\hat{f}(x_0)]-f(x_0)$;
- reorganize terms in the expected test error by adding and subtracting $E[\hat{f}(x_0)]$
